        <h1>1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const?</h1>
        <p>Ans: The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.</p>

        <h1>2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined ?</h1>
        <p>Ans: Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>
        <h1>3.What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p>Ans: What is a REST API? An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
